So I'm trying to write a [Tic-Tac-Toe game](http://github.com/mzemel/blockchain_tictactoe) on the blockchain to understand Solidity/Truffle development, get experience with the compiler, understand the ABI, contracts, the whole nine yards.  But I've been stuck for two days on this problem:

I have a struct:

```
struct Game {
  address xPlayer;
  address oPlayer;
  bool xTurn;
  bool gameOver;
  bool xWon;
  int8[9] board;
}
```

and a function that sets up a particular `Game`:

```
mapping(address => Game) public games;

function createGame(address gameAddress, address opponent) returns (bool) {
  games[gameAddress] = Game({
    xPlayer: opponent,
    oPlayer: msg.sender,
    xTurn: false,
    gameOver: false,
    xWon: false,
    board: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    });

  return true;
}
```

`board` represents a Tic-Tac-Toe board.  I've played around with making it `int8[9]`, `string`, `bytes32`, and can't get any to work:

###`int8[9]`:

Does not get returned by the public getter.  In a test file,

```
address gameAddress;
var (xPlayer, oPlayer, xTurn, gameOver, xWon, board) = ticTacToe.games(gameAddress);
```

Results in:

`TypeError: Not enough components (5) in value to assign all variables (6).`

Uh, so my struct getter is only returning 5 components when called externally?

###`string`:

Fine, I'll try a string.  I set the `board` to `'000000000'`.  That gets me past the destructuring problem!  But now my assertion:

`Assert.equal(board[0], '0', 'Board is intialized to 0s.');`

Results in:

`TypeError: Indexed expression has to be a type, mapping or array (is inaccessible dynamic type)`

So basically, strings can't be returned externally either?  They're returned as `inacessible dynamic type` and you can't coerce them to `bytes32` or anything that implements the `[]` method.

###`bytes32`:

Well, [this StackExchange post](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/12765/type-inaccessible-dynamic-type-is-not-implicitly-convertible-to-expected-type/12767) indicates I should use `bytes32` to pass around externally.

Alright, my test is passing: I can access the 0th element and it's the value I'm expecting.  Hooray!

So I write a new function, one that lets me enter moves.

```
function move(address gameAddress, uint256 index) {
  Game storage game = games[gameAddress];
  if(game.xTurn) {
    require(msg.sender == game.xPlayer);
    game.board[0] = 'X';
  } else {
    game.board[0] = 'O';
  }

  game.xTurn = !game.xTurn;
}
```

However, this doesn't compile:

```
TypeError: Expression has to be an lvalue.
game.board[0] = 'O';
```

The [docs](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html#arrays) don't talk much about `bytes32` but mention you can convert a `string` into bytes with the `bytes()` function.

But that still doesn't solve my problem of trying to access the value from outside of the contract because you can't return strings!!

From everything I've looked at, I _should_ be able to say `game.board[0] =`.  Even if I create a new `bytes32` I _still_ can't use `[]` on it, which makes absolutely NO sense because I can use `[]` in the tests.

I'm incredibly frustrated an on the edge of pulling my hair out.  Next steps: plead for help, pay for help, or try to import a [string library](https://github.com/Arachnid/solidity-stringutils)

I just wish the compiler would give me more information, the Truffle test framework would let me put in breakpoints and inspect the return values I'm getting, and that there is more of a community who can answer these questions and explain what the right move is here.
