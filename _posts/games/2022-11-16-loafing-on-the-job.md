Looking for a holiday gift for that special someone (a.k.a. you)?

Back in 2020, while the pandemic was in full swing, I designed a satirical board game called <i>Loafing on the Job</i>. A game for 2-5 players, it takes place in corporate dystopia â€” and is the only game about getting paid to poop!

Play as a corporate drone flittering about the office, as you complete your endless list of menial tasks: spike your coffee, update your LinkedIn, console the new hire, give the client a kidney... but watch out! Once your stomach begins to rumble, you only have so many turns to find a toilet and relieve yourself.

Watch out for co-workers, who slow you down with small talk. Use farts to blast a path through them, but with every gamble comes risk.

It's a race against the clock to complete your tasks before a player poops their pants. Earn additional points for demolishing toilets, and for making co-workers run gagging from the room!

Every game comes with a guarantee to delight (as long as your sense of humor is warped), as well as:

* 8 3D-printed toilets
* Deluxe quad-fold game board
* Deck of poker-quality cards
* Professionally printed box and tuckbox
* Colorful wooden meeples, cubes, and more
* A pre-written apology for whoever sees it on your shelf!
