Hi, welcome to my website.

I'm here to chew bubblegum and make friends, and I'm all outta bubblegum.

Hi, I'm Michael!

I'm a programmer, working mostly in Ruby and Javascript.

My background is in psychology and biology, but for the past 7 years I've been working as a web developer.

Outside of work, I enjoy tennis, disc golf, board games, chess, and backpacking.

I have a beautiful wife and a dog.  This is my dog.

Thanks for stopping by!
