Hi!  Thanks for checking out my website.

I've been coding for about 8 years, 5 of it professionally.  I started with PHP for my grad school advisor's project management web application.  That was my first major exposure to Linux.  After that, I started writing Bash and C++ to help control data collection in my research lab.  My first development position was a Rails developer for the university's radio station, which I picked up as I was losing interest in research biology.  I implemented a bug tracking system, provisioned my first server, and developed an iPhone app to stream live music from the station.

As I was leaving the university, I got my first professional job with Househappy, a real estate start-up, as a junior developer.  That was a great opportunity to learn more about Rails and Backbone while on a team, delivering features, working under deadlines, and ensuring the site stayed up.  It was also my first exposure to writing gems, exploring servers, and working with third party APIs.

After a year and a half, I took a job at SweetSpot as a software engineer, working on maintenance of a monolithic legacy application.  As we transitioned to microservices, I learned about distributed architecture and wrote my own services with Sinatra and Phoenix.  I also got the chance to solve some neat math puzzles and learned the importance of an organization that encourages professional development.

After two years, I quit that job to travel abroad.  When I came back, I took a senior engineering position with PhishMe, which is where I currently work.  I am heading up a project for our first microservice, help out where I can with architectural decisions, and leave a trail of documentation and process improvements wherever I go.

For fun, I love board games (especially chess), playing bluegrass music, traveling, and reading.  This is a blog of some of the projects I've worked on over time.  Hope you enjoy!
